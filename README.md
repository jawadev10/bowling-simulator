## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests


Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). I highly suggest to use https://wallabyjs.com/ for testing. And in a common professional project, I prefer to use JEST instead of Karma :p.
